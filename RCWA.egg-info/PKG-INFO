# RCWA

## About this code

RCWA (for Rigorously Coupled Wave Analysis) is a simulation method for electromagnetic problems. It uses a decomposition of the simulated domain on a base (here, Fourier modes) to solve Maxwell's equations and find the structure's modes.

## Installation

Not yet on PyPi, will probably one day, but for the moment you can simply clone this repository
